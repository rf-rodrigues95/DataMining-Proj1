# PAD-Project1
First part of the Project for the Data Analysis and Mining course at NOVA Universidade de Lisboa, 2024-2025.  

## Running
To run the Jupyter Notebooks, it is required for the appropriate dataset(s) to be located in the `data/` folder, in the same level as the code files. Other than that, the required packages are listed in the `requirements.txt` file and can be installed via `pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt`.
